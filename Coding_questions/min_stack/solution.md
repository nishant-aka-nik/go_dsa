Sure! Let’s walk through designing a MinStack in Go that supports push, pop, top, and getMin operations, all in constant time (O(1)). I’ll provide the solution, explain it step-by-step in simple terms, and give you some tips for interviews.

Solution in Go
```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// MinStack defines the stack structure
type MinStack struct {
	stack    []int // main stack to store all values
	minStack []int // auxiliary stack to keep track of minimums
}

// Constructor initializes the MinStack
func Constructor() MinStack {
	return MinStack{
		stack:    []int{},
		minStack: []int{},
	}
}

// Push adds an element to the stack
func (ms *MinStack) Push(val int) {
	ms.stack = append(ms.stack, val) // Push to main stack

	// If minStack is empty or new val is <= current min, push it to minStack
	if len(ms.minStack) == 0 || val <= ms.getCurrentMin() {
		ms.minStack = append(ms.minStack, val)
	}
}

// Pop removes the top element from the stack
func (ms *MinStack) Pop() {
	if len(ms.stack) == 0 {
		return // Stack is empty, nothing to pop
	}

	top := ms.stack[len(ms.stack)-1] // Get the top element
	ms.stack = ms.stack[:len(ms.stack)-1] // Remove it from main stack

	// If the popped element is the current min, remove it from minStack as well
	if top == ms.getCurrentMin() {
		ms.minStack = ms.minStack[:len(ms.minStack)-1]
	}
}

// Top retrieves the top element of the stack
func (ms *MinStack) Top() int {
	if len(ms.stack) == 0 {
		return -1 // Or handle as per requirements
	}
	return ms.stack[len(ms.stack)-1]
}

// GetMin retrieves the minimum element in the stack
func (ms *MinStack) GetMin() int {
	if len(ms.minStack) == 0 {
		return -1 // Or handle as per requirements
	}
	return ms.getCurrentMin()
}

// Helper function to get current minimum
func (ms *MinStack) getCurrentMin() int {
	return ms.minStack[len(ms.minStack)-1]
}

// Example usage
func main() {
	minStack := Constructor()
	minStack.Push(-2)
	minStack.Push(0)
	minStack.Push(-3)
	fmt.Println(minStack.GetMin()) // Outputs: -3
	minStack.Pop()
	fmt.Println(minStack.Top())    // Outputs: 0
	fmt.Println(minStack.GetMin()) // Outputs: -2
}
```
How It Works: Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Understanding the Problem

You need a stack that, in addition to regular stack operations (push, pop, top), can also return the smallest element in the stack at any time, all in constant time (O(1)).

2. Why Two Stacks?

To achieve O(1) time for getMin, we use two stacks:

	•	Main Stack (stack): Stores all the pushed values.
	•	Min Stack (minStack): Keeps track of the minimum values.

3. Pushing an Element

When you push a new value:

	•	Always push it onto the main stack.
	•	If the min stack is empty or the new value is less than or equal to the current minimum, also push it onto the min stack.

Why?

	•	The min stack always has the current minimum at its top. If a new value is smaller or equal, it becomes the new minimum.

4. Popping an Element

When you pop:

	•	Remove the top element from the main stack.
	•	If the popped element is equal to the top of the min stack, also pop it from the min stack.

Why?

	•	If the popped element was the current minimum, the next element in the min stack will be the new minimum.

5. Getting the Top Element

Simply return the top of the main stack.

6. Getting the Minimum Element

Return the top of the min stack, which always holds the current minimum.

7. Example Walkthrough

Let’s walk through the example in the main function:

	1.	Push -2:
		•	stack: [-2]
		•	minStack: [-2] (since -2 is the first element)
	2.	Push 0:
		•	stack: [-2, 0]
		•	minStack: [-2] (0 is not less than -2)
	3.	Push -3:
		•	stack: [-2, 0, -3]
		•	minStack: [-2, -3] (-3 is new minimum)
	4.	GetMin():
		•	Returns -3 (top of minStack)
	5.	Pop():
		•	Removes -3 from stack
		•	Also removes -3 from minStack because it was the current minimum
	6.	Top():
		•	Returns 0 (new top of stack)
	7.	GetMin():
		•	Returns -2 (new top of minStack)

Tips for Solving This Problem in Interviews

	1.	Understand the Requirements:
		•	Know that all operations must be O(1).
		•	Recognize that simply keeping track of the minimum isn’t enough; you need a way to update it efficiently.
	2.	Use Auxiliary Data Structures:
		•	Think about using an extra stack to keep track of the minimums.
		•	This avoids having to scan the entire stack to find the minimum each time.
	3.	Handle Edge Cases:
		•	What if the stack is empty and pop or top is called?
		•	Decide how to handle these cases (e.g., return -1 or an error).
	4.	Explain Your Thought Process:
		•	During the interview, clearly explain why you choose to use two stacks.
		•	Walk through an example to demonstrate how your solution works.
	5.	Optimize for Space (if possible):
		•	While the basic solution uses two stacks, you can optimize space by only storing a new minimum when it changes.
		•	However, the two-stack approach is typically sufficient and easy to implement.
	6.	Practice Coding the Solution:
		•	Write the code multiple times to get comfortable with stack operations in your chosen language.
		•	Make sure you understand how to manipulate slices in Go, as they are used to implement stacks.
	7.	Think About Alternatives:
		•	Although the two-stack method is standard, being aware of other methods (like storing pairs) can showcase your depth of understanding.

Final Thoughts

Implementing a MinStack efficiently requires understanding how to maintain additional information (the current minimum) without increasing the time complexity of your operations. By using an auxiliary stack to keep track of minimum values, you ensure that all operations remain O(1), making your solution both efficient and elegant.

Keep practicing similar problems, and you’ll get comfortable with these patterns. Good luck with your interviews!
