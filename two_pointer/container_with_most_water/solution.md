Sure! Let’s break down the Trapping Rain Water problem, understand how to solve it using Go, and provide some tips to help you remember the solution for interviews.

Problem Overview

Given an array of non-negative integers representing an elevation map where each bar has a width of 1, we need to determine how much water can be trapped after it rains.

Example:

	-	Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
	-	Output: 6

Visualization:

Elevation Map: 
|       #
| #     # #
| # #   # #
| # # # # #
---------------
Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

Water trapped is the space between the bars where water can accumulate, totaling 6 units in this example.

Solution Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we’ll use the Two Pointers Approach, which offers O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. Here’s how it works:

	1.	Initialize Two Pointers:
	-	Left Pointer (left): Starts at the beginning of the array.
	-	Right Pointer (right): Starts at the end of the array.
	2.	Track Maximums:
	-	Left Maximum (leftMax): The highest bar encountered from the left.
	-	Right Maximum (rightMax): The highest bar encountered from the right.
	3.	Move Pointers Towards Each Other:
	-	Compare height[left] and height[right].
	-	If height[left] is less than height[right]:
	-	If height[left] >= leftMax, update leftMax.
	-	Else, water can be trapped at left, add leftMax - height[left] to the total.
	-	Move left pointer to the right.
	-	Else:
	-	If height[right] >= rightMax, update rightMax.
	-	Else, water can be trapped at right, add rightMax - height[right] to the total.
	-	Move right pointer to the left.
	4.	Continue Until Pointers Meet:
	-	Repeat the process until left and right pointers cross each other.

Go Implementation

Here’s how you can implement the above strategy in Go:

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func trap(height []int) int {
	if len(height) == 0 {
		return 0
	}

	left, right := 0, len(height)-1
	leftMax, rightMax := height[left], height[right]
	totalWater := 0

	for left < right {
		if height[left] < height[right] {
			// Move left pointer
			if height[left] >= leftMax {
				leftMax = height[left]
			} else {
				totalWater += leftMax - height[left]
			}
			left++
		} else {
			// Move right pointer
			if height[right] >= rightMax {
				rightMax = height[right]
			} else {
				totalWater += rightMax - height[right]
			}
			right--
		}
	}

	return totalWater
}

func main() {
	// Test cases
	height1 := []int{0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1}
	fmt.Println("Output for height1:", trap(height1)) // Expected: 6

	height2 := []int{4,2,0,3,2,5}
	fmt.Println("Output for height2:", trap(height2)) // Expected: 9
}

Step-by-Step Explanation

Let’s walk through the code to understand how it works:

	1.	Initialization:
	-	left starts at index 0.
	-	right starts at the last index (len(height) - 1).
	-	leftMax is initialized to height[left].
	-	rightMax is initialized to height[right].
	-	totalWater will accumulate the trapped water.
	2.	Main Loop (for left < right):
	-	Compare height[left] and height[right]:
	-	If height[left] is less, we focus on the left side:
	-	If height[left] is greater than or equal to leftMax, update leftMax.
	-	Else, water can be trapped at left: add leftMax - height[left] to totalWater.
	-	Move left pointer one step to the right.
	-	Else, we focus on the right side:
	-	If height[right] is greater than or equal to rightMax, update rightMax.
	-	Else, water can be trapped at right: add rightMax - height[right] to totalWater.
	-	Move right pointer one step to the left.
	3.	Termination:
	-	The loop continues until left and right meet.
	-	totalWater now holds the total trapped water.
	4.	Return the Result:
	-	The function returns totalWater.

Example Walkthrough

Let’s apply the algorithm to height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]:

1.	Initial State:
-	left = 0, right = 11
-	leftMax = 0, rightMax = 1
-	totalWater = 0
2.	First Iteration:
-	height[left] = 0 < height[right] = 1
-	height[left] (0) >= leftMax (0): Update leftMax to 0.
-	Move left to 1.
3.	Second Iteration:
-	height[left] = 1 >= height[right] = 1
-	height[right] (1) >= rightMax (1): Update rightMax to 1.
-	Move right to 10.
4.	Continue Iterations:
-	Repeat the process, updating leftMax and rightMax, and adding trapped water accordingly.
5.	Final State:
-	totalWater = 6

Tips for Interviews

1.	Understand the Problem:
    -	Visualize the elevation map and how water traps between bars.
	-	Think about how the amount of water at each position depends on the tallest bars to its left and right.
2.	Two Pointers Approach:
	-	It’s efficient and uses constant space.
	-	Remember to track leftMax and rightMax.
	-	Decide which pointer to move based on the comparison of height[left] and height[right].
3.	Edge Cases:
	-	Empty array ([]) should return 0.
	-	Arrays with less than 3 bars cannot trap water.
4.	Practice Coding:
	-	Write the code multiple times to get comfortable with pointer movements and conditions.
5.	Explain Your Thought Process:
	-	During the interview, verbalize your reasoning.
	-	Draw diagrams if possible to illustrate how water is trapped.
6.	Time and Space Complexity:
	-	Be ready to discuss that the solution runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) additional space.
7.	Alternative Solutions:
	-	Know that there’s also a dynamic programming approach using two arrays to store leftMax and rightMax, but it’s less efficient in space.

Common Mistakes to Avoid

-	Not Updating leftMax and rightMax Correctly:
-	Ensure you update the maximum heights appropriately as you move the pointers.
-	Incorrect Pointer Movement:
-	Always move the pointer (left or right) that has the smaller current height.
-	Overlooking Edge Cases:
-	Handle cases where the input array is empty or has very few elements.

By understanding the Two Pointers Approach and practicing the implementation, you’ll be well-prepared to tackle the Trapping Rain Water problem in interviews. Good luck!
