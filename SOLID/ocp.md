The **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)** is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design, which aims to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Understanding OCP is crucial, especially for interviews, as it demonstrates your ability to write scalable and maintainable code.

## What is the Open-Closed Principle?

**Open-Closed Principle** states that:

> *Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be **open for extension** but **closed for modification**.*

In simpler terms, you should be able to add new functionality to a system without altering its existing code. This reduces the risk of introducing bugs into existing, working code when adding new features.

### Why is OCP Important?

- **Maintainability:** Reduces the likelihood of bugs when modifying code.
- **Scalability:** Makes it easier to add new features without disrupting existing functionality.
- **Reusability:** Promotes designing components that can be reused in different contexts.

## Applying Open-Closed Principle in Go

Go, being a statically typed and compiled language, doesn't have traditional object-oriented features like inheritance. However, it supports interfaces and composition, which can be leveraged to adhere to the Open-Closed Principle.

### Example 1: Shape Drawing

**Scenario:** You have a set of shapes (e.g., Circle, Rectangle) and you need to draw them.

#### Violation of OCP

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Circle struct {
    Radius float64
}

type Rectangle struct {
    Width, Height float64
}

func drawShape(shape interface{}) {
    switch s := shape.(type) {
    case Circle:
        fmt.Printf("Drawing Circle with radius %f\n", s.Radius)
    case Rectangle:
        fmt.Printf("Drawing Rectangle with width %f and height %f\n", s.Width, s.Height)
    default:
        fmt.Println("Unknown shape")
    }
}

func main() {
    c := Circle{Radius: 5}
    r := Rectangle{Width: 3, Height: 4}
    drawShape(c)
    drawShape(r)
}
```

**Problems:**
- Adding a new shape requires modifying the `drawShape` function, violating OCP.

#### Applying OCP

Use interfaces to allow extension without modifying existing code.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Shape interface is open for extension via new shape types
type Shape interface {
    Draw()
}

type Circle struct {
    Radius float64
}

func (c Circle) Draw() {
    fmt.Printf("Drawing Circle with radius %f\n", c.Radius)
}

type Rectangle struct {
    Width, Height float64
}

func (r Rectangle) Draw() {
    fmt.Printf("Drawing Rectangle with width %f and height %f\n", r.Width, r.Height)
}

func drawShape(s Shape) {
    s.Draw()
}

func main() {
    c := Circle{Radius: 5}
    r := Rectangle{Width: 3, Height: 4}
    drawShape(c)
    drawShape(r)

    // Adding a new shape without modifying existing drawShape
    t := Triangle{Base: 6, Height: 7}
    drawShape(t)
}

type Triangle struct {
    Base, Height float64
}

func (t Triangle) Draw() {
    fmt.Printf("Drawing Triangle with base %f and height %f\n", t.Base, t.Height)
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Adding `Triangle` doesn't require changing `drawShape`.
- `Shape` interface remains unchanged, adhering to OCP.

### Example 2: Notification System

**Scenario:** Implement a notification system that can send notifications via different channels (e.g., Email, SMS).

#### Violation of OCP

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Email struct {
    Recipient string
    Content   string
}

type SMS struct {
    Number  string
    Content string
}

func sendNotification(notification interface{}) {
    switch n := notification.(type) {
    case Email:
        fmt.Printf("Sending Email to %s: %s\n", n.Recipient, n.Content)
    case SMS:
        fmt.Printf("Sending SMS to %s: %s\n", n.Number, n.Content)
    default:
        fmt.Println("Unknown notification type")
    }
}

func main() {
    email := Email{Recipient: "user@example.com", Content: "Hello via Email!"}
    sms := SMS{Number: "+1234567890", Content: "Hello via SMS!"}
    sendNotification(email)
    sendNotification(sms)
}
```

**Problems:**
- Adding new notification types requires modifying `sendNotification`.

#### Applying OCP

Use interfaces to allow adding new notification types without modifying existing code.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Notifier interface allows extension for new notification types
type Notifier interface {
    Send()
}

type Email struct {
    Recipient string
    Content   string
}

func (e Email) Send() {
    fmt.Printf("Sending Email to %s: %s\n", e.Recipient, e.Content)
}

type SMS struct {
    Number  string
    Content string
}

func (s SMS) Send() {
    fmt.Printf("Sending SMS to %s: %s\n", s.Number, s.Content)
}

func sendNotification(n Notifier) {
    n.Send()
}

func main() {
    email := Email{Recipient: "user@example.com", Content: "Hello via Email!"}
    sms := SMS{Number: "+1234567890", Content: "Hello via SMS!"}
    sendNotification(email)
    sendNotification(sms)

    // Adding PushNotification without modifying sendNotification
    push := PushNotification{UserID: "user123", Content: "Hello via Push!"}
    sendNotification(push)
}

type PushNotification struct {
    UserID  string
    Content string
}

func (p PushNotification) Send() {
    fmt.Printf("Sending Push Notification to %s: %s\n", p.UserID, p.Content)
}
```

**Benefits:**
- New notification types like `PushNotification` can be added without altering `sendNotification`.
- The `Notifier` interface remains unchanged, adhering to OCP.

### Example 3: Payment Processing

**Scenario:** Implement a payment system that supports multiple payment methods (e.g., CreditCard, PayPal).

#### Violation of OCP

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type CreditCard struct {
    Number string
    CVV    string
}

type PayPal struct {
    Email string
}

func processPayment(payment interface{}) {
    switch p := payment.(type) {
    case CreditCard:
        fmt.Printf("Processing Credit Card payment for %s\n", p.Number)
    case PayPal:
        fmt.Printf("Processing PayPal payment for %s\n", p.Email)
    default:
        fmt.Println("Unknown payment method")
    }
}

func main() {
    cc := CreditCard{Number: "1234-5678-9012-3456", CVV: "123"}
    pp := PayPal{Email: "user@example.com"}
    processPayment(cc)
    processPayment(pp)
}
```

**Problems:**
- Adding new payment methods requires modifying `processPayment`.

#### Applying OCP

Use interfaces to support new payment methods without changing existing processing logic.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Payment interface allows extension for new payment methods
type Payment interface {
    Process()
}

type CreditCard struct {
    Number string
    CVV    string
}

func (cc CreditCard) Process() {
    fmt.Printf("Processing Credit Card payment for %s\n", cc.Number)
}

type PayPal struct {
    Email string
}

func (pp PayPal) Process() {
    fmt.Printf("Processing PayPal payment for %s\n", pp.Email)
}

func processPayment(p Payment) {
    p.Process()
}

func main() {
    cc := CreditCard{Number: "1234-5678-9012-3456", CVV: "123"}
    pp := PayPal{Email: "user@example.com"}
    processPayment(cc)
    processPayment(pp)

    // Adding BitcoinPayment without modifying processPayment
    btc := BitcoinPayment{WalletAddress: "1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa"}
    processPayment(btc)
}

type BitcoinPayment struct {
    WalletAddress string
}

func (bp BitcoinPayment) Process() {
    fmt.Printf("Processing Bitcoin payment for wallet %s\n", bp.WalletAddress)
}
```

**Benefits:**
- New payment methods like `BitcoinPayment` can be introduced without altering `processPayment`.
- The `Payment` interface remains unchanged, adhering to OCP.

## Tips to Memorize Open-Closed Principle for Interviews

1. **Understand the Core Idea:**
   - **Open for Extension:** You can add new functionality.
   - **Closed for Modification:** You don’t need to change existing code to add new functionality.

2. **Use Real-World Analogies:**
   - Think of software modules as building blocks. You can add new blocks without dismantling the existing structure.

3. **Remember the Interface-Based Approach:**
   - In Go, interfaces are your friends for adhering to OCP. They allow you to define contracts that can be fulfilled by various implementations.

4. **Practice with Multiple Examples:**
   - Work on different scenarios (like the ones above) to see how OCP applies in various contexts.

5. **Visualize Before Coding:**
   - Before writing code, sketch out how new features can be added without altering existing structures.

6. **Use Mnemonics:**
   - **O**pen for **E**xtension, **C**losed for **M**odification → OEM (like Original Equipment Manufacturer).

7. **Explain It to Someone Else:**
   - Teaching the concept to a peer or even to yourself can reinforce your understanding.

8. **Relate to Other SOLID Principles:**
   - Understanding how OCP interacts with other principles (like Single Responsibility or Dependency Inversion) can provide a holistic view.

9. **Review and Refactor Existing Code:**
   - Take code that violates OCP and refactor it to comply. This hands-on practice solidifies the concept.

10. **Stay Updated with Go Idioms:**
    - Familiarize yourself with Go’s best practices and idioms, as they often align with SOLID principles.

## Summary

The Open-Closed Principle is fundamental for building scalable and maintainable software. By leveraging interfaces and composition in Go, you can design systems that are easy to extend without modifying existing code. Practicing various examples and understanding the underlying concepts will not only help you adhere to OCP in your projects but also prepare you effectively for interviews.
